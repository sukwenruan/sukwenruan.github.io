The main goals of WOD 5.1: SmartPhoneProducts1 with variables were to understand referencing variables, as well as using a separate JavaScript file to avoid hard-coding information while it is integrated with a HTML file. For further details of WOD 5.1, visit this <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/050.variables_data_types/experience-SmartPhoneProducts1_variables.html">link</a>.

WOD 5.1 was relatively easy and straightforward. Utilizing regEx for finding and replacing the elements made this WOD extremely efficient to do. However, ensuring that the regEx is correct is essential to getting it to work, as most of my difficulties were due to mistyping the regEx. In addition, it is important to make sure that the correct variables are being used in all locations, respectively. 

I prepared by doing a few run-throughs of the instructions before watching the solution, which is similar to how I complete my other WODs. To be better prepared, I recommend researching certain code, instead of doing it without thought, because it helps with understanding in cases of error. As I mentioned earlier, doing this WOD can be smoother if you ensure that the correct variables and regEx are being used as you go.
